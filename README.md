# A test for a new website

A while back, I built a small tool that takes a bunch of `.md` files from my Jekyll blog and served them as JSON over a REST API. 

This is the first test to create a frontend to consume that API. 

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve
```
